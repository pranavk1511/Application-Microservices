## README for Dockerized Flask Application
This README provides instructions for building and running a Dockerized Flask application using the provided Dockerfile.

### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile defines the environment and dependencies needed to run a Flask application. Below are the key components of the Dockerfile:
```bash
dockerfile
Copy code
FROM python:3.10-slim-bullseye

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests build-essential libpq-dev python3-dev && pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip

WORKDIR /app
COPY ./requirements.txt /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --requirement /app/requirements.txt
COPY . /app

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "server.py"]
```
### Build Docker Image
To build the Docker image, execute the following command in the directory containing the Dockerfile:#
```bash
docker build -t your_image_name .
```
### Run Docker Container:
Once the image is built, you can run a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 your_image_name
```

### Access the Application
The Flask application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 in your browser or through API requests.

### Important Notes
The Dockerfile is based on the python:3.10-slim-bullseye image.
It installs necessary dependencies, sets the working directory, and copies the application files.
The application is exposed on port 5000.
Ensure your Flask application (server.py) listens on the correct host and port.
Feel free to customize the Dockerfile or adapt it to your specific requirements.
